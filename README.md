Guide for installing Minion Pro and Myriad for MikTeX
====================

Intro
----------

This is a guide to install Minion Pro and Myriad Pro for the use with MikTeX's pdflatex.

Overall this guide aimed at entry-level users. If you work through the file named *mpro-installation-guide-miktex.pdf*, you should be set to go.

The use of pdflatex enables you to use micro-typesetting features more easily in comparison to Xe(La)TeX.

Questions?
-------------

If you have questions, please do not hesitate to ask [here at latex-community.org](http://latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=9274) or the good folks at [TeX.SX](http://tex.stackexchange.com), they are a highly compentent bunch and you will certainly learn good amount of other things about LaTeX. :)

Newer Version
------------------

There is also Sebastian Schubert's version of Minion Pro and Myriad Pro: https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro.

They are newer and certainly easy to install on a UNIX-like system. I recommend to check it out and give it a try!
