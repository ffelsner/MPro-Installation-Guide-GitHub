\noindent \textbf{Preamble:}\\
This is a simple guide for installing Minion Pro and Myriad Pro for the use with MikTeX on a machine that runs with Windows. The guide works for any of the following operating systems: XP, Vista or Seven. This document is intended for entry-level users. If you know how to install a font for MikTeX, you can close this document. There may be other ways to correctly install a font--consider this more of a log of the steps that I (successfully) took. This guide is solely based on the advice I got and the steps I took and of all the steps I took especially the steps that worked.
